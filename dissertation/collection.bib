They are used in many fields including electrical engineering, software engineering and web design. Recognizing shapes in these sketches is a challenging task due to the imprecision with which they are drawn. We tackle this challenge with a visual approach to recognition. The approach is based on a representation of a sketched shape in terms of the visual parts it is made of. By taking this part-based visual approach we are able to recognize shapes that are extremely difficult to recognize with current sketch recognition systems that focus on the individual strokes.

An ensemble of four template classifiers ranks each definition according to similarity with an unknown symbol. Scores from the individual classifiers are then aggregated to determine the best definition for the unknown. Ordinarily, template-matching is sensitive to rotation, and existing solutions for rotation invariance are too expensive for interactive use. We have developed an efficient technique for achieving rotation invariance based on polar coordinates. This techniques also filters out the bulk of unlikely definitions, thereby simplifying the task of the multiclassifier recognition step.},

	abstract = {We have created {LADDER}, the first language to describe how sketched diagrams in a domain are drawn, displayed, and edited. The difficulty in creating such a language is choosing a set of predefined entities that is broad enough to support a wide range of domains, while remaining narrow enough to be comprehensible. The language consists of predefined shapes, constraints, editing behaviors, and display methods, as well as a syntax for specifying a domain description sketch grammar and extending the language, ensuring that shapes and shape groups from many domains can be described. The language allows shapes to be built hierarchically (e.g., an arrow is built out of three lines), and includes the concept of "abstract shapes", analogous to abstract classes in an object oriented language. Shape groups describe how multiple domain shapes interact and can provide the sketch recognition system with information to be used in top-down recognition. Shape groups can also be used to describe "chain-reaction" editing commands that effect multiple shapes at once. To test that recognition is feasible using this language, we have built a simple domain-independent sketch recognition system that parses the domain descriptions and generates the code necessary to recognize the shapes.},

In this paper we explore how conceptual visualizations (such as diagrams, visual metaphors, charts, sketches) can be constructed and used as cognitive artefacts that support collaborative knowledge work. In order to facilitate tasks such as the creation and sharing of knowledge in teams, we propose a collaborative dimensions framework as a tool for understanding how visual artefacts can facilitate collaboration in circumstances that involve distributed knowledge. The framework is based on the widespread Cognitive Dimensions of Notation framework and is enriched with criteria from the boundary object paradigm discussed in organization science. The dimensions of the framework are described and then applied to three different visualizations that are used in collaborative knowledge work. A discussion of future research needs concludes the paper.},

	abstract = {Although mobile, tablet, large display, and tabletop computers increasingly present opportunities for using pen, finger, and wand gestures in user interfaces, implementing gesture recognition largely has been the privilege of pattern matching experts, not user interface prototypers. Although some user interface libraries and toolkits offer gesture recognizers, such infrastructure is often unavailable in design-oriented environments like Flash, scripting environments like {JavaScript}, or brand new off-desktop prototyping environments. To enable novice programmers to incorporate gestures into their {UI} prototypes, we present a "\$1 recognizer" that is easy, cheap, and usable almost anywhere in about 100 lines of code. In a study comparing our \$1 recognizer, Dynamic Time Warping, and the Rubine classifier on user-supplied gestures, we found that \$1 obtains over 97\% accuracy with only 1 loaded template and 99\% accuracy with 3+ loaded templates. These results were nearly identical to {DTW} and superior to Rubine. In addition, we found that medium-speed gestures, in which users balanced speed and accuracy, were recognized better than slow or fast gestures for all three recognizers. We also discuss the effect that the number of templates or training examples has on recognition, the score falloff along recognizers' N-best lists, and results for individual gestures. We include detailed pseudocode of the \$1 recognizer to aid development, inspection, extension, and testing.},

	abstract = {We present {SketchREAD}, a multi-domain sketch recognition engine capable of recognizing freely hand-drawn diagrammatic sketches. Current computer sketch recognition systems are difficult to construct, and either are fragile or accomplish robustness by severely limiting the designer's drawing freedom. Our system can be applied to a variety of domains by providing structural descriptions of the shapes in that domain; no training data or programming is necessary. Robustness to the ambiguity and uncertainty inherent in complex, freely-drawn sketches is achieved through the use of context. The system uses context to guide the search for possible interpretations and uses a novel form of dynamically constructed Bayesian networks to evaluate these interpretations. This process allows the system to recover from low-level recognition errors (e.g., a line misclassified as an arc) that would otherwise result in domain level recognition errors. We evaluated Sketch-{READ} on real sketches in two domains--family trees and circuit diagrams--and found that in both domains the use of context to reclassify low-level shapes significantly reduced recognition error over a baseline system that did not reinterpret low-level classifications. We also discuss the system's potential role in sketch based user interfaces.},

In order to facilitate the integration of sketching into traditional user interfaces, we must first develop accurate ways of recognizing users' intentions while providing feedback to catch recognition problems early in the sketching process. One approach to sketch recognition has been to recognize low-level primitives and then hierarchically construct higher-level shapes based on geometric constraints defined by the user, however, current low-level recognizers only handle a few number of primitive shapes. We propose a new low-level recognition and beautification system that can recognize eight primitive shapes, as well as combinations of these primitives, with recognition rates at 98.56\%. Our system also automatically generates beautified versions of these shapes to provide feedback early in the sketching process. In addition to looking at geometric perception, much of our recognition success can be attributed to two new features, along with a new ranking algorithm, which have proven to be significant in distinguishing polylines from curved segments.},

By viewing sketched drawings as utterances in a visual language, sketch recognition can be posed as an ambiguous parsing problem. On this premise we have developed an algorithm for ink parsing that uses a statistical model to disambiguate. Under this formulation, writing a new recognizer for a visual language is as simple as writing a declarative grammar for the language, generating a model from the grammar, and training the model on drawing examples. We evaluate the speed and accuracy of this approach for the sample domain of the {SILK} visual language and report positive initial results.},
