\section{Overview}
This project was an exploration of Human Computer Interface concepts governing the interactions of users with tools that let them explore and visualise data. It involved creating a tool that lets users create charts to visualise data in a quick but exploratory manner. 

The end result is a proof-of-concept charting application that works as below:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The user imports data from a Microsoft Excel file.
\item They sketch a rough indication of a chart.
\item They drag the data onto elements of the chart to actually bind the data to the chart. 
\item The tool then creates a 'formal' chart.
\item The tool transforms the user's original sketch to more closely match the formal chart, making the mapping between sketch and formal chart elements evident to the user.
\item Any changes on either the sketch or formal chart is fed through to the other view. For example, erasing the a sketched bar removes a data series from the formal bar.
\end{enumerate}
