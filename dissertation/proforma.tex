\section*{Original Aims}
This project aims to explore if users are able to create content faster, or experiment with it more, if given the tools to directly manipulate their creation. Specifically, it involved:
\begin{enumerate}

	\item Building an application that lets users create graphical visualisations of their data by simply sketching their desired output, like they would on paper.

	\item Evaluating the learnability of the interface, and how it compares to existing tools for creating charts, through a user study.

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Work Completed}
I have completed all core work items by building a Chart component for desktop applications that successfully runs sketch recognition on user input to determine what they intend to create, and then generates those chart graphics for them. I have also designed and built an interface that makes the learning curve for interacting with this component short and gentle, by applying HCI principles. 

A few extensions were also completed, including allowing edits to the formal chart to flow back and manipulate the raw sketches.

\section*{Special Difficulties}
None.
