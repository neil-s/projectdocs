\section*{Original Aims}
This project aimed to enable users to visualise information faster, and encourage them to explore and experiment with it more. This would be done by building a tablet application that draws on the familiar metaphor of sketching using pen and paper. Users must be able to make a rough sketch of the type of chart they'd like to see. An ink stroke recogniser must then complete the chart with user data. Such a tool should provide the benefits of direct manipulation and liveness, since user actions receive immediate feedback. These benefits need to be evaluated through a user study.

\section*{Work Completed}
I have successfully designed and developed a charting application that meets all the functional and usability requirements, and includes three extensions. The sketch recognition component uses multiple data mining algorithms to recognise chart elements drawn on a tablet with a stylus. The custom charting widget plots user data into the chart type the user sketched. The interface was designed to be easy to learn - this was evaluated through a user study. The charting widget is ready to be open sourced and included in other applications. In the process, I also contributed two bug fixes to tools used in the project.


\section*{Special Difficulties}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Acquiring and fixing the source code of a component used for sketch recognition from the team that wrote it.
	\item Automating the testing of the highly visual parts of the project.
\end{itemize}
